Python toolkit to get started with data science and machine learning notebooks

When I started learning python, I used to get lost in what concepts to learn in python language, especially coming from a non programming background. This repository is aimed to help learners from non computer science backgorund to know what key concepts of python progamming language is important for data science and machine learning projects.

This repository will have a series of notebooks to get learn basic python concepts necessary to get started with data science and machine learning projects. In future, I will be adding notebooks for learning to key python libararies - pandas and numpy.
