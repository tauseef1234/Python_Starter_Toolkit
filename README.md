# Python_Starter_Toolkit

Python toolkit to get started with data science and machine learning notebooks

When I started learning python, I used to get lost in what concepts to learn in python language, especially coming from a non programming background. This repository is aimed to help learners from non computer science backgorund to know what key concepts of python progamming language is important for **data science** and **machine learning** projects.

This repository will have a series of notebooks to get learn basic python concepts necessary to get started with data science and machine learning projects. In future, I will be adding notebooks for learning key python libraries - pandas and numpy.

Some of the examples in these notebooks have been referenced from [learnbyexample](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python/) and [real python](https://realpython.com/) which are very good resources to learn python.

Python:

1. Part 1
    - Math Operators
    - Variables
    - Flow Control
    - Boolean Operators

    - Dictionary continued
    - Comprehension

3. Part 3
    - Strings
    - Python escape sequences
    - String Slicing
    - If-Else-Elif
    - Loops - For & While
    
4. Part 4
    - OOPS (Classes, objects and methods)
    - Inheritance
    - super()
5. Functions
    - functions using def
    - lambda functions
    - lambda functions with map, filter and reduce

Pandas

1. Part 1
   - Series, Dataframes
   - Basic methods(head, tail, unique, etc.)
   - Filtering
   - Pivoting

2. Part 2
   - Concat/Append
